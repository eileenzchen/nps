Capital One Software Engineering Summit Coding Challenge: National Park Service
---
This is my solution to a web app for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit coding challenge. Requirements for the project can be found on the [Mindsumo site](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/national-park-api). Everything was designed and implemented by me.

**The web app can be found on Heroku [here](https://peaceful-harbor-33144.herokuapp.com).** 

### Key features
- Use of National Park Service API, Google Custom Search API (for relevant Google images), Google Maps API
- Filtering park name, state, or designation, and keyword search for easy finding of parks and information
- Separate page for educational information about each park
- Interactable calendar of events
- Use of NPS Symbol Library [on github](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/symbol-library)
